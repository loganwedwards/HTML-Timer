HTML-Timer
==========

A minimalist timer that uses JQuery and CSS3 keyframes and animations.

Notes:
1. This timer is not yet mobile friendly, i.e., it does not respond to touch events
2. The Mozilla and Opera prefixes are not yet added
3. Due to whatever font is used for the clock (non-monospaced), the time display is not fixed and is slightly distracting.

License: Feel free to use, distribute, pull apart and change its oil. This project started as a learning experiment for myself.
